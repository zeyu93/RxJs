    <h2>Basics:</h2>

      >When using reactive programming, data streams are going to be the spine
      of your application. Events, messages, calls, and even failures are going
      to be conveyed by a data stream. With reactive programming, you observe
      these streams and react when a value is emitted.</strong
    >
    <p>
      <b> Stream</b> is a concept, which are values or events that are emitted
      over time. For example: Filling in a form online
    </p>
    <p>
      <b> Observable</b> facilties the stream, An observable is a function that
      produces a stream of values to an observer over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Observers</b> When you subscribe to an observable, you are an observer.
      Any time we subscribe, we create an observer. They read values coming from
      the observables. They take <b>Next</b>, <b>Error</b>,<b>Complete</b>
      We can also unsubscribe to these observerables when we no longer need to
      receive further emitted values.
      <br />
      We can also create multiple observers/subscriptions on the same
      observerable, this is good for different areas from same data.
    </p>
    <h2>Hot vs Cold observerables</h2>
    <p>
      What is a Cold observerable? It is the above example, in which an
      observerable 's producer is only when a subscrip has been activated.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Warm/Hot observerable is when the values are created outside the actual
      bserverable. A truly hot observable is one that emits values without a
      subscriber having subscribed to it.
    </p>

    <h2>Subject</h2>
    <p>
      It is an observer and observerable at the same time because it can emit
      its own values.
    </p>

    <h2>Operators</h2>
    <p>
     They are methods that can be used on the Observerables , and can change the original and return a new observerable.
     Pure functions.
